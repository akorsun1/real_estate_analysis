Predicting House Prices in King County, WA
Problem Statement:
This is a project for a real estate agency that helps homeowners sell their homes. I have been tasked to analyze King County housing data set to provide the agency with advice about which home renovations might increase the estimated value of a home so seller can decide which renovations to make. Therefore, in my data analysis, I will explore the most impactful features in terms of pricing.
