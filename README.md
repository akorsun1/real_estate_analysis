## Predicting House Prices in King County, WA

## Problem Statement:

This is a project for a real estate agency that helps homeowners sell their homes. I have been tasked to analyze King County housing data set to provide the agency with advice about which home renovations might increase the estimated value of a home so seller can decide which renovations to make. Therefore, in my data analysis, I will explore the most impactful features in terms of pricing.

## Approach and methodology:

1. Import the data
2. Clean the data
3. Explore the data
4. Model 
5. Interpret
6. Recommendations
7. Conclusions
8. Future work

## Diagonal correlation matrix

Diagonal correlation matrix answers some important questions for my analysis, for example, "How does building grade impact sales price?" and "Which features are the most impactful in terms of pricing?".

According to this correlation matrix, I can assume that bulding grade impacts price significantly due to their high correlation level (0.68). Also with the help of the matrix, I can state that the next features are the most impactful in terms of pricing: sqft_living,grade, bathrooms.

However, my analysis will be more valuable if I will use other methods to answer my research questions.
